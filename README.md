# FindR

**Find and replace, and related packages**

Multiple find and replace (FnR) packages that can be used together or separately to build a customized experience.

## Roadmap:

- fnr-scripts: Search and replace javascript functions (fnr-text [fnr-md, fnr-tsv], fnr-dom, fnr-perf).
- fnr-ui: Standalone React Components Library for Search and replace (fnr-mui,fnr-rhc).
- fnr-highlighter: Standalone Highlighting Library.
